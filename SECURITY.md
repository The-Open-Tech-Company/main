This security policy outlines the terms of use for the services and products provided by The Open Tech Company (TOTC), as well as the basic conditions for interactions between users of the products and representatives of the company when threats and vulnerabilities in the code are detected.

TOTC's products are distributed on an "as-is" basis, meaning that they may contain problems and errors, and are distributed under an open license. 

If vulnerabilities are identified, users are encouraged to fix them themselves and distribute the updated, secure code through open-source distribution platforms (such as GitHub or GitVerse), or to inform TOTC using the specified communication channels.

All TOTC products have an MVP (minimum viable product) status. TOTC is not obligated to provide emergency fixes for vulnerabilities, except in cases where they interfere with the core functionality of the product. We are not responsible for security issues arising from the code, nor are we obligated to assist with the consequences.
